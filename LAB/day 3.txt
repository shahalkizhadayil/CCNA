 What’s happening here?
PC1 is trying to get an IP address using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

A packet is being sent from PC1 to R1 with the destination IP 255.255.255.255 (broadcast) to locate a DHCP server.

The PDU (Protocol Data Unit) is captured at Router R1, showing what happens to the packet across the OSI layers.

 OSI Layer Breakdown (as seen in the left panel):
OSI Layer	Information Shown
Layer 7 (Application)	DHCP packet: Requesting IP address from server.
Layer 4 (Transport)	UDP protocol (Src Port: 68, Dst Port: 67 – standard for DHCP).
Layer 3 (Network)	IP Header – Source IP: 0.0.0.0 (no IP yet), Destination: 255.255.255.255 (broadcast).
Layer 2 (Data Link)	Ethernet frame – Broadcast MAC address (FFFF.FFFF.FFFF).
Layer 1 (Physical)	Implied: transmission over physical medium (e.g., Ethernet cable).

 Network Devices Overview:
PC1: Sends DHCP request.

SW2 & SW1 (Switches): Forward the frame through the network.

R1 (Router): Receives the DHCP packet and likely forwards it if DHCP relay is configured.

SRV1 (Server): Appears to be a DHCP server (IP .100), expected to respond with IP info.

R2: Part of the extended network, not involved in this specific DHCP flow.

 Objective of the Task:
Observe DHCP broadcast using simulation mode.

Identify which OSI layers are used during this process.

Layer 7 (Application Layer) traffic is triggered by releasing/renewing the IP
