Today i learn about IP address classes and their default subnet masks in both CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and dotted decimal format, along with their binary representation.

Explain in detail:

* Class A
CIDR Notation: /8

Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0

Binary Mask: 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000

Explanation:

The first 8 bits are reserved for the network portion.

Remaining 24 bits are used for host addresses.

Suitable for very large networks (up to ~16 million hosts per network).

IP range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255

* Class B
CIDR Notation: /16

Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0

Binary Mask: 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000

Explanation:

The first 16 bits are for the network.

Last 16 bits are for hosts.

Suitable for medium-sized networks (~65,000 hosts).

IP range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255

* Class C
CIDR Notation: /24

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Binary Mask: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000

Explanation:

First 24 bits are for the network.

Last 8 bits are for hosts.

Suitable for small networks (up to 254 hosts).

IP range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
