* Networking Example: MAC Address Learning and Switching
In this diagram, we have a small network setup with:

2 Switches: SW1 and SW2

4 PCs:

PC1 (MAC: .0001)

PC2 (MAC: .0002)

PC3 (MAC: .0003)

PC4 (MAC: .0004)

The switches are connected to each other using port F0/3

* What is Happening?
PC3 wants to send a frame to PC1.

The frame has:

Source MAC: .0003 (PC3)

Destination MAC: .0001 (PC1)

* Step-by-Step Communication:
PC3 sends the frame to SW2 through port F0/1
→ SW2 learns: “Oh! MAC .0003 is on F0/1”

SW2 checks its MAC table
→ It already knows that MAC .0001 is on F0/3 (going to SW1)
→ So, SW2 forwards the frame to SW1 through F0/3

SW1 receives the frame on F0/3
→ SW1 learns: “MAC .0003 is on F0/3”
→ It checks its table and sees that MAC .0001 is on F0/1 (where PC1 is)

SW1 sends the frame to PC1 via F0/1

* MAC Address Tables:
SW1 Table:

.0001 → F0/1

.0003 → F0/3

SW2 Table:

.0003 → F0/1

.0001 → F0/3

* Conclusion:
This is an example of how switches learn MAC addresses.

No broadcasting is needed since both switches already know where the destination is.

The communication is efficient and direct
