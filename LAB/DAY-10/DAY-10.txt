IPv4 Header :
Version (4 bits)

Indicates the IP version (IPv4 = 4).

IHL (Internet Header Length) (4 bits)

Specifies the length of the IP header in 32-bit words.

Minimum value is 5 (20 bytes, no options).

DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) (6 bits)

Used for QoS (Quality of Service) to classify packets.

ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) (2 bits)

Used for signaling network congestion without dropping packets.

Total Length (16 bits)

Length of the entire packet (header + data) in bytes.

Identification (16 bits)

Identifies fragments of the original IP datagram.

Flags (3 bits)

Controls and identifies fragments.

Bit 0: Reserved

Bit 1: Donâ€™t Fragment (DF)

Bit 2: More Fragments (MF)

Fragment Offset (13 bits)

Indicates the position of a fragment in the original packet.

Time To Live (TTL) (8 bits)

Prevents infinite looping. Decreases by 1 at each router.

Protocol (8 bits)

Specifies the protocol in the data portion (e.g., TCP=6, UDP=17, ICMP=1).

Header Checksum (16 bits)

Used to verify errors in the header.

Source IP Address (32 bits)

The sender's IP address.

Destination IP Address (32 bits)

The receiver's IP address.

Options (variable)

Optional field, used if IHL > 5. Rarely used.
