This shows a Cisco Packet Tracer activity focused on configuring basic security for a router (R1) and a switch (SW1) through the CLI (Command Line Interface). The task involves setting and encrypting access passwords using the enable password and enable secret commands. Initially, an unencrypted password "CCNA" is configured, and later, password encryption is enabled using the service password-encryption command, which converts plain-text passwords into encrypted format (type 7). A stronger, encrypted password "Cisco" is then added using the enable secret command, which uses type 5 encryption and overrides the weaker one. The hostname of the router is set to "R1" as part of the configuration. The right side of the image shows the CLI output where these commands have been successfully applied, and the configurations are verified using show startup-config. This setup is a typical exercise in securing device access and understanding encryption methods on Cisco devices.
