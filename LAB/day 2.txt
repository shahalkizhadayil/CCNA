4 Routers (R1, R2, R3, R4) are used to connect two different LAN segments.

Switches (SW1 to SW8) connect devices inside each LAN.

End devices include:

3 PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3)

1 Server (SRV1)

Key Connections:
Router to Router (R1-R3) uses fiber cable for long distance (3 km).

Router to Switch connections are made using crossover cables (assuming Auto-MDIX is off).

Switch to Switch and Switch to PC/Server use straight-through cables.

Purpose:
This setup helps learners understand:

Device interconnections (Routers, Switches, PCs, Servers)

Proper cable types for different connections

Realistic network distances and layout
